{"name":"Atom-ide-purescript","tagline":"Atom package for PureScript build, completion, etc support","body":"# ide-purescript package for Atom\r\n\r\nThis package provides editor support for PureScript projects in Atom. You should\r\nfirst install required dependency [language-purescript](https://atom.io/packages/language-purescript)\r\nwhich also provides syntax highlighting and [psc-ide](https://github.com/kRITZCREEK/psc-ide) (see below).\r\n\r\nThis package provides:\r\n  * Build and error reporting\r\n  * Autocompletion\r\n\r\nPackage should trigger on opening a `.purs` file.\r\n\r\n## Autocomplete\r\n\r\nProvided from [psc-ide](https://github.com/kRITZCREEK/psc-ide).\r\n\r\n1. Start `psc-ide-server` in your project directory\r\n1. Configure `psc-ide` path for the package\r\n1. Actually build your project\r\n1. Load the modules you want to use as completion sources: `echo \"dependencies My.Project.Module\" | psc-ide`\r\n1. Edit a `.purs` file and you should see completion.\r\n\r\n## Custom port\r\n\r\nTo run `psc-ide-server` on a custom port, start the command\r\nwith the `-p` flag, e.g. `psd-ide-server -p 4243`. Then\r\nset the same number in the package settings.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\nBuild support is experimental as I don't like any of the options yet. Depending on\r\nwhich other packages you have installed, this package provides (via `pulp build`)\r\n\r\n  * [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) support - a bit annoying since\r\n  compile on save is too slow, but some nice messages\r\n\r\n  * [Build](https://atom.io/packages/build) support - will only work properly in\r\n  PureScript projects if you don't have Gulpfile etc., as `pulp` is always used\r\n  but custom providers are at the bottom of the priority list.\r\n\r\nMight be that something like [Build linter support](https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build/pull/117) could\r\nbe useful, or build triggered from this package.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
